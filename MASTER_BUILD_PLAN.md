## PHASE 1: CORE AGENT ORCHESTRATION SYSTEM

### 1.1 Agent Coordination Engine (Backend)
Create a real multi-agent system that:
- Spawns specialized AI agents (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
- Coordinates parallel execution
- Manages inter-agent communication
- Handles task decomposition and delegation
- Implements real-time status updates via WebSocket
- Creates checkpoints at each completed step

### 1.2 Agent Types Required
1. **Planning Agent** - Analyzes user requirements, creates detailed build plan
2. **Architect Agent** - Designs system architecture, database schemas, API structure
3. **Frontend Agent** - Builds React/Vue/Next.js components with proper styling
4. **Backend Agent** - Creates API endpoints, business logic, database queries
5. **Database Agent** - Designs and implements schemas, migrations, seeders
6. **Testing Agent** - Writes and runs tests, validates functionality
7. **DevOps Agent** - Configures deployment, Docker, CI/CD
8. **Review Agent** - Code review, security audit, quality assurance

## PHASE 6: AGENT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### 6.1 WebSocket Events
```
agent:spawned - New agent created
agent:working - Agent started task
agent:progress - Incremental update
agent:completed - Task finished
agent:error - Error occurred
agent:message - Agent communication
build:started - Build initiated
build:progress - Overall progress
build:checkpoint - Checkpoint created
build:completed - Build finished
file:created - New file generated
file:updated - File modified
code:generated - Code chunk ready
terminal:output - Shell output
preview:ready - App preview available
```

### 6.2 Real-Time Dashboard
